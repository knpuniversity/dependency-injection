You fixed Bob's code to not use globals anymore.
"But wait!" - he says - "What's so wrong with using
globals? My code was a lot easier before!".

The only true statement is (B): globals makes your code difficult
to debug, understand and maintain. When using `global \$emailLoader`,
it's not clear where this is created or who created it. And what's
worse, in a different file, you may innocently rename or remove
`\$emailLoader` not realizing that many other parts of your code
are relying on this being available globally!

Writing code where you pass in needed values (dependency injection)
takes more work. The pay-off are classes that are easier to read
and a lot more predictable (and more unit-testable, etc).
